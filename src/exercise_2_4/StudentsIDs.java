/* HashMap:
Make a program similar to GradebookHashMap, but which takes
in students names and ID numbers (as integers) instead of
names and grades. In this case, however, the keys should
be integers (the IDs) and the values should be strings
(the names). Modify the roster printing code accordingly.
